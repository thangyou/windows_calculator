## On a side note
> I was doing my assignment using another repository. However, several file conflicts occurred while handling issues, making serveral mistakes. I wanted to solve it, but I couldn't. So I created a new repository. The task was almost finished, working 'pull request'. It breaks my heart. ðŸ˜‚
